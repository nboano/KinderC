## Introduction

KinderC is a C++ library that, combined with the clang compiler, allows you to build fast and responsive web applications using the C++ language.  

You just have to write your program file, for example `main.cpp`, where you have included the `kinderc.hpp` header file, and compile it using the `kccompile` script into a WebAssembly binary that will be included into your HTML page and executed.

That's it. Enjoy!

## Requisites

To start using KinderC...

- You should know the C/C++ syntax. You don't have to know *everything* about these languages, but just how to creates simple programs (for example, a Console application) with them.
- You should have installed the clang compiler, which is necessary to compile your projects. If you don't, download it from [here](https://releases.llvm.org/download.html).
